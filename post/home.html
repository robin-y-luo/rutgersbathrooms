				<p class="secondary-statement">We'd rather you use a good one.</p>

				<p>Rutgers Bathrooms, a subsection of the Rutgers Review, is a blog that takes you through a journey, both personal and literal, through the bathrooms of this great university. We take the hard job of investigating the dark depths of Rutgers' various restrooms and report back on overall condition and vibe. Attending university can be, at times, weird and scary and embarrassing when you are completely cast into darkness and unfamiliarity in a new environment. Weâ€™re here to help with that. At least the bathrooms part of that. Come along as we catalogue the mundanity of daily life through the lens of all the bathrooms we visit. Look back on our words 5, 10 years from now and reminisce about how terrible, but also beautiful and wonderful it was, to have the privilege of using a bathroom on a college campus.</p>
