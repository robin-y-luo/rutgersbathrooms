        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <img src="../images/history.png" width="80%">
        <p>Rutgers Bathrooms started off as a dumb joke between friends and a spark in everyone's hearts across America. We understand more than anyone that only two things are guaranteed in this life: death, taxes, and needing to use a bathroom. Well okay, that was actually three things now that I think of it. None of us were math majors in college. If you are actually a math major and wanting to help out, keep scrolling to the Join the Team section. If you're a math major, rich, and taller than 6 feet, feel free to contact my personal home phone number!</p>

        <h2>Join the Team!</h2>
        <p>In order to join us, you must solve our riddles three. One of us on the team always tells the truth, another always lies, and then the other one kind of stands around confused and unsure how to answer. Submit your applications via glass bottle to the nearest river on the next night of the full moon. Good luck!</p>
